## What is DOM99 ?

DOM99 is a JavaScript framework to ease the interaction between the HTML and your program. Declaratively select HTML elements, add event listeners and synchronize UI elements and JavaScript variables, populate HTML templates with data and insert it in the document.
You can also build the HTML with custom elements.
