## Reporting Guidelines

## Addressing Grievances
 
If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. Contact details are in available in the documentation.


## Notes

Improve the world is not well defined. Also be nice. What does it even mean to be ? At least "be nice" negates insulting, intolerance, harassment and everything else that everyone dislikes. Improve the world negates spam. Learn in Expected Behaviour would allow to kick someone that never learns (or tells so), that a behaviour is not nice even after warnings.
